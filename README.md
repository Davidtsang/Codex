# Codex

**If you want a stable product, use the releases. Master is almost always broken.**

Codex is a text editor for programmers built with PyQt4 and QScintilla.

# Installation
First you'll need to install [Python 2.7.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [PyQt 4](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download), and [QScintilla2](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/download).
From there run

	python Codex/Writer.py

from the directory you downloaded Codex into. A more official way of installing Codex with a Makefile and whatnot is coming soon.
